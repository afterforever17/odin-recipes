        <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 medium eggplant, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
        <li>1 cup marinara sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>8 slices mozzarella cheese, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, salt, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, and
            black pepper in a shallow bowl. Place flour in a separate shallow bowl and beaten eggs in a third shallow
            bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip sliced eggplant first in flour, then in beaten eggs, and finally coat with bread crumb mixture. Place
            coated eggplant on a tray and let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place breaded eggplant rounds in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching; work in batches if
            necessary. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, flip each round, and cook until desired crispiness is achieved, 4 to 6
            minutes more.</li>
        <li>Top each eggplant round with marinara sauce and 1 slice of mozzarella cheese. Place the basket back in the
            air fryer and cook until cheese has started to melt, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining eggplant, if
            necessary.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
