This repo aims the be a practice project and a milestone for The Odin Project lessons.

Although I am experienced with basic web development tools, I am aiming to learn something new and challenge myself for the improvement of my skills.


Note after project completion (the HTML part):
To be completely honest, I have already done a small project like this one year ago.
Back then I finished it in around 2-3 hours because I wasn't very familiar with shortcuts or writing HTML in general.

Now it took around 30 minutes and I can say that I am seeing the progress I have made in a year and I am proud of myself.
